# MERNFileBrowserOnABrowser
A file browser made with the MERN stack

If you're too lazy to install samba on your raspberry pi,
or you just want to browse the contents of a computer in your network or online
then this app may help.

#TODO:
1) Make links from the directories that are returned from the ls
1.a) Make icons from the directories
2) Show current working directory


9999) Make a root mode. I mean, why not, don't be crazy enough to run this in public *shurg emojji*
